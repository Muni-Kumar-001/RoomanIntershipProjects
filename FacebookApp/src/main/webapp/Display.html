						At first thought, it may seem unexpected for a sci-fi film to include genuine super natural beings.
						The main reason for this most likely stems from the traditional separations between genres:
						 super natural elements fill fantasy, sometimes horror, while science fiction is science fiction.
						 Wild things can happen with cutting-edge technologies, but they strictly involve natural (if sometimes rogue) processes.
						 Kalki 2898 AD, directed by Nag Ashwin, finds a way to marry the two worlds,
						 providing for some engaging set pieces with far more of an organic connection than you think
						 given the mythological elements at play here. Incorporating science fiction is a smart way to deal with the time-spanning
						 implications of reincarnating deities and long historical eras, creating an integrated world that feels genuinely unique in its implications.
					</p>
					<p>
						Big ideas abound in Kalki 2898 AD, and it's evident that the film is intended to spark a larger set of worlds and stories.
						That's something often seen these days, at least in Hollywood... after all, why wouldn't every studio want its own genre-defining,
						 multi-part moneymaker? It's still admittedly refreshing to see an international production take large swings fueled by important world religions
						  and folklore, and better yet to see those spun into original worldbuilding with high-stakes conflict. As with any ambitious project, 
						  there are very good decisions here that occasionally suffer from limiting ones. Strong performances fuel characters that are sometimes
						   either underutilized or otherwise sent on too many sidequests when the bigger narrative awaits. Nevertheless, Kalki 2898 AD as a whole
						    is an engaging film with big ideas and strong character work, building an expansive world worth exploring.
